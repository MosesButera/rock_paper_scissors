Problem solving: 

Reword it in plain English until it makes sense to you. 

STEP 2: 
-Write logic to get computer choice.Write a function that randomly 
returns "rock", "paper" or "scissors".Get computer input randomly (either rock,paper, or scissors).

Generate a random number between integers 0 and 3 exclusively. 
Either 1,2, or 0. 
If 1 return rock
If 2 return paper
if 0 return scissors


Step 3:
Write the logic to get the human choice. You will write a function 
that takes the user choice and returns it.

Prompt the user to enter either ROCK, PAPER, or SCISSORS
If ROCK, return ROCK
If PAPER, return PAPER
If SCISSORS, return SCISSORS

STEP 4: 
Create two new variables named humanScore and computerScore in 
the global scope.
Initialize those variables with the value of 0.

STEP 5: 
Write the logic to play a single round.
Your game will be played round by round. 
You will write a function that takes the 
human and computer player choices as arguments, 
plays a single round, increments the round winnerâ€™s score and 
logs a winner announcement.

If 
human = ROCK comp = PAPER return "You lose! Paper beats Rock" 
ROCK SCISSORS
PAPER ROCK
PAPER SCISSORS
SCISSORS ROCK
SCISSORS PAPER

STEP: 6
Create a new function name playGame that 
calls playRound to play 5 rounds
Keeps track of the scores 
Declares a winner at the end.

Declare a round variable and initialize it to 0.
Create a new function playGame:
Use for loop. While round is less than 5 run/call/play playGame function or play the game
Store the result in either human/computer score.
Repeats until all five rounds are done and output the score
and declares the winner.
